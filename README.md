# WordsPerMinute_Java
Words Per Minute Java program. 
Simple WPM program to practice Java, using 10 words as a sample and calculating the speed by seeing how fast those words can be typed. 
Might add a spell checker later to make sure all words are spelled correctly to be counted toward the wpm result.
